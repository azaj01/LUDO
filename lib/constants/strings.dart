Setup: Each player chooses one of the 4 corners on the board as their home base and takes all 4 pieces that are the same color. All 4 pieces are placed inside the home base1.

Starting the Game: Each player takes a turn rolling the die. The player who rolls the highest number takes the first turn. After that, each player takes turns going clockwise around the board1.

Moving Pieces: To move a piece out of your base onto the main track, you need to roll a 6. If you roll a 1-5, you can’t use your roll to move a piece to the main track1.

Bonus Roll: After any time you roll a 6, you earn a bonus roll1.

Eliminating Opponents’ Pieces: If you land on a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, that piece is sent back to its base2.

Reaching Home: The goal is to move all your pieces from your base to your home triangle by following the path on the board3. You need to roll the exact number to reach your home triangle3.

Winning the Game: The first player to move all their pieces to the home triangle wins the game2.

Remember, the game requires a balance of luck and strategy. Enjoy your game of Ludo!
